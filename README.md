# NM4ES_Exercises_on_Matlab
Here you can find the exercises and solutions of the Laboratory sessions for the course of Numerical Methods for Engineering Sciences. Each folder contains a Lab session on a specific topic. You will find a .pdf file with the text of the exercises, some Matlab functions implemented during the Lab session, and some Matlab scripts which test the proposed codes according to the exercises.

Have fun!
